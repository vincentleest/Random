Ask about ASCII / UNICODE string

Can optimize by returning false when strlen is greater than number 
of unique characters. 

Coded a O(n^2) solution.


Optimal:
Since already to a range. Should use bitset, and check duplicate from there. 
Time: O(n) solution 
Space: O(1) solution 

Others: 
if can modify the string Sort and compare neighboring chars. O(nlog(n))
